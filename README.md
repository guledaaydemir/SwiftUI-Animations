## Introduction

This project showcases various animation techniques implemented using SwiftUI. Each animation example is contained in its own SwiftUI view, providing a practical demonstration of how animations can be used to create engaging and visually appealing user interfaces.

## Animations

### ðŸ”º Splash Screen Animation

This animation demonstrates a dynamic splash screen that transitions smoothly into the main content of the app.

### ðŸ”º Button Press Effects

Button press effects add visual feedback to user interactions, enhancing the overall user experience.

* **Scale & Shadow Effect:** The "Scale & Shadow" button scales down and applies a shadow effect when pressed. The button smoothly scales down and simultaneously adds a subtle shadow to mimic a pushed effect. When released, the button returns to its original size and shadow disappears.

* **Rotation Effect:** The "Rotation" button demonstrates a rotation animation effect. Upon pressing, the button smoothly rotates by 45 degrees using the .rotationEffect() modifier, adding a playful element to the interaction.

* **Press & Release Effect:** The "Press & Release" button showcases a scaling effect with shadow. When pressed, the button slightly scales down and adds a shadow to simulate depth. Upon release, the button returns to its original size and the shadow disappears.

* **Continuous Animation Effect:** The "Continuous Animation" button features a continuous scaling animation. It continuously alternates between full size and slightly smaller size, creating an engaging and dynamic effect.

* **Bounce Animation Effect:** The "Bounce Animation" button employs an interpolating spring animation. Upon pressing, the button scales down and then bounces back with a spring-like motion, providing a lively and interactive experience.

### ðŸ”º Card Flip Animation

Parallax scrolling creates a captivating visual effect where background elements move at different speeds, providing depth to the user interface.

### ðŸ”º Loading Indicator

Loading indicators provide users with feedback during data loading or processing tasks.

### ðŸ”º Modal Presentation

Modal presentations overlay a new view on top of the current one, offering a focused context for specific actions or information.

### ðŸ”º Chart Animations
